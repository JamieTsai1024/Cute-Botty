# JamHacks Hackathon V 2021

## Description
* Created "Cute Botty", a fun Discord Bot  
* Used the "Emotions dataset for NLP" [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/praveengovi/emotions-dataset-for-nlp) dataset to train our bot in identifying emotions from messages
* Used the [youtube_dl API](https://pypi.org/project/youtube_dl/) along with [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org), to allow the bot to download and play music within voice chats in the server

## Commands  
#### CASUAL COMMANDS
* __$hello__: Says hi!
* __$join__: Joins the user's voice channel
* __$leave__: Leaves the current voice channel
* __$add [user ping] [theme song]__: Adds a theme song for a user
* __$react [message]__: Reacts to the message using one of six emojis: sadness, anger, love, joy, fear, and surprise
* __$help__: Displays a list of commands
#### DANGER ZONE
